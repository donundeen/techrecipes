# techrecipes
Here's where I'll post little mini-solutions I've developed for various tech problems. 

The Goal: A place for ME to go for snippets I need to remember. A place to share with other solutions that took me a while to figure out.

Most of my problem-solving is around network/wireless communicaiton of some sort. Connections between different environments. Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Node, Max, Python, etc.

Solutions might look like code, or a process expressed in another readme document, maybe including screenshots. Might even be some 3D/Lasercut models for cases, recommended hardware for connecting things, etc. Or might be a link to a better, "official" solution

Will have a nice index/table of contents

Later I could make each recipe into a blog/social media post or something.

# TODO
- Udp/OSC communication btw max, node, python, arduino, web, etc
- esp32 communication
- rPi thermal printer
- audio in RPi
- Max/Msp Patches
