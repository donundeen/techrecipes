# Arduino ESP32 Access Point for Wifi Config

Tested on Arduino Feather Huzzah ESP32

With this code, if your ESP32 can't connect to the internet, it will create its own access point that you can connect to and then enter the network credentials for the WiFi network you want to connect to.
The Arduino will remember the connection details. You can save multiple credentials, if you're moving aroudn with the arduino to different networks. It will automatically connect to the available network
